# Overview

This is a speed cooking app where the goal is just to cool as much Takoyaki as possible within a time limit. It also uses a database to record and compare high scores.

# Future Work

List of things that I need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* Add the next cooking steps which include adding the toppings
* Polish the mechanics. The takoyaki should be forced to only cook after a few seconds to simulate cooking
* Add a few more assets and fix the score board.
